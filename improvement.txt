There are several directions for further improvement of your folder comparison tool (`cmpf`). Below are some concrete suggestions, ranging from usability enhancements and feature additions to code-level improvements.

---

## 1. **Feature Additions**
- **File Type Filtering:** Add an option to compare only certain file types/extensions (e.g., only `.txt` or `.png`).
- **Size-Only Comparison:** Fast option to compare files by size before doing hashes, or as its own mode.
- **Ignore Files/Patterns:** Enable .gitignore-style filtering or an option to specify patterns/files to skip.
- **Parallelization Control:** CLI option to control number of threads in batch mode.
- **Detailed CSV/HTML Reports:** Export results to CSV or HTML in addition to TXT/JSON.
- **Interactive Mode:** CLI prompts to select folders or choose options interactively when none are passed.
- **Cross-Platform Improvements:** Improve path handling or symbolic link recognition, especially for Windows.
- **add -H flag to enable hidden files/folders coparisone.

## 2. **Performance & Scalability**
- **Incremental Comparison:** Cache past results and only compare changed/new files ("smart compare").
- **Memory/Efficiency Tweaks:** Use memory-mapped files for hashing large files, or chunked hashing for very large files.
- **Large Directory Support:** Algorithmic improvements or controls for directories with tens of thousands of files.
