There are several directions for further improvement of your folder comparison tool (`cmpf`). Below are some concrete suggestions, ranging from usability enhancements and feature additions to code-level improvements.

---

## 1. **Output & Usability Improvements**
- **Progress Bar for Realtime Mode:** You already have a progress bar in batch mode. Adding one to realtime mode would improve user experience for large directories.
- **Summary Table Enhancement:** Make summary more visually appealing (e.g., ASCII or colorized table).
- **Better Error Reporting:** Show which files failed to scan/hash and why.
- **Dry-Run/Preview Option:** Allow users to preview what would be compared without running full hashes.

## 2. **Feature Additions**
- **File Type Filtering:** Add an option to compare only certain file types/extensions (e.g., only `.txt` or `.png`).
- **Size-Only Comparison:** Fast option to compare files by size before doing hashes, or as its own mode.
- **Ignore Files/Patterns:** Enable .gitignore-style filtering or an option to specify patterns/files to skip.
- **Parallelization Control:** CLI option to control number of threads in batch mode.
- **Detailed CSV/HTML Reports:** Export results to CSV or HTML in addition to TXT/JSON.
- **Interactive Mode:** CLI prompts to select folders or choose options interactively when none are passed.
- **Cross-Platform Improvements:** Improve path handling or symbolic link recognition, especially for Windows.

## 3. **Performance & Scalability**
- **Incremental Comparison:** Cache past results and only compare changed/new files ("smart compare").
- **Memory/Efficiency Tweaks:** Use memory-mapped files for hashing large files, or chunked hashing for very large files.
- **Large Directory Support:** Algorithmic improvements or controls for directories with tens of thousands of files.

## 4. **Advanced Features**
- **Cloud/Remote Folder Support:** Compare folders over network/remote protocols (FTP, SFTP, SMB, etc.).
- **File Content Diffs:** If files differ and both are text files, show a line-by-line difference instead of just hashes.
- **Duplicate Detection:** Find files duplicated within/between folders (optional flag).
- **Compare File Metadata:** Optionally compare timestamps, permissions, owner/group, etc.

## 5. **Quality & Distribution**
- **Automated Tests:** Add unit/integration tests to ensure correctness and stability.
- **Release Binaries:** Provide prebuilt binaries for common platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Docs & Usage Examples:** Improve README with troubleshooting, screenshots, and additional examples.
- **Benchmarking Section:** Document or expose performance benchmarks compared to similar tools.

## 6. **User Feedback**
- **Collect usage statistics or anonymous bug reports** (opt-in only).
- **“Suggest improvement/feature” command:** Add a CLI flag that outputs URL for opening a feature request.
