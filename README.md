'''# Folder File Comparison Utility

A command-line utility for comparing the files in two folders, implemented in **Rust**.   
The tool compares files by their names and **blake3** **sha256**  hashes, reporting matches, differences, missing, and extra files.  

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Compare two directories**: Checks for files with the same name in both folders.
- **blake3 and  sha256 hash comparison**: Compares file contents securely using blake3, sha256 or both.
- **Colorized terminal output**: Easy-to-read, informative, and visually appealing output.
- **Summary section**: Lists total files, matches, differences, missing, and extra files, with aligned formatting.
- **JSON and TXT output**: Save the comparison report as a `json` or `txt` file.
- **Timer**: Shows how long the comparison took to finish.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build & Usage

#### üì¶ Requirements

- Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

#### ‚öôÔ∏è  Build

```sh
cargo build --release
```

#### üöÄ Usage

```sh
# from rust/ folder
cargo build --release

# run with both hashes (default)
./target/release/cmp-folders ./dirA ./dirB

# run with only BLAKE3
./target/release/cmp-folders ./dirA ./dirB --algo=blake3

# run with only SHA-256
./target/release/cmp-folders ./dirA ./dirB --algo=sha256

# Save report as a txt file
./target/release/cmp-folders ./dirA ./dirB --output-folder=./reports --output-format=txt

# Save report as a json file
./target/release/cmp-folders ./dirA ./dirB --output-folder=./reports --output-format=json
```

#### üìù Example

```sh
./target/release/cmp-folders ./dirA ./dirB
```

         Comparing files in folders:            
           Folder 1: ./dirA                     
           Folder 2: ./dirB                     
-----------------------------------------------

[MATCH]   file1.txt
[DIFF]    file2.txt
[MISSING] file3.txt not found in Folder2
[EXTRA]   file4.txt only in Folder2

-----------------------------------------------
                 Summary
-----------------------------------------------
Total files checked  : 3
Matches              : 1
Differences          : 1
